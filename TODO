* mention further turkic transducers in future work

* more about tagset
* the evaluation/statistics section needs adding to.. eg. we need to describe the evaluation

This paper presents a morphological transducer of the Kyrgyz language oriented
for the task of machine translation, which utilizes an available platform HFST.
The transducer firstly takes surface forms and generates all possible lexical
forms, and secondly takes lexical forms and generates one or more surface
forms.
The advantage of the transducer is generating an increased lexicon with a good
coverage. However, the morphological and syntactic disambiguation becomes more
urgent. It is suggested that more detailed analysis about the ambiguity problem
and the grammatical problem is necessary.

This paper describes work on the morphology of Kyrghyz. Some socio-political
information about the language is given.

"has been widely used for other Turkic languages". Could you name the languages
in the text (Turkish, Crimean Tatar and Turkmen)?

What do you mean by "possessive morphology" and "case morphology"? Does that
mean "possessive or case markers/affixes/suffixes"? Because you say "after a
noun", does that mean that these are some lexical items?

"as depicted in table". There is no such table in the paper.

The paper provides an evaluation of the coverage of the morphological analyzer
by use of two corpora. This yields a coverage of more than 4 words out of 5 (>
80%) for more than 7,000 stems.

The conclusion is a little bit too allusive about the missing forms to be
handled by the analyzer. Could a better evaluation of what remains to described
be given? For instance, in terms of percentage of 'static' forms for each POS?

Minor remark:

use { and } around {Central Intelligence Agency} in the LaTeX bibliography, so
that 'Central Intelligence' do not appear as first names.

The  paper describes the development of a morphological transducer targeting
for the task of machine translation of the  Kyrgyz language using the
free/open-source platform HFST. The transducer is mainly focused on the
auspices of the Apertium Forcada et al. (2011) project for use in a machine
translation system from Turkish to Kyrgyz.
The paper technically accurate and provides a lot of insight on the
difficulties of the Kirgyz language as well as the coverage of the language and
the usage of the output of the system - a morphological analyzer. The analyzer
is working both ways, i.e., from a surface form to all possible lexical forms
and from a lexical form to possible surface forms.
The transducers showed good coverage between 81 - 87 % depending on the
corpora. However the authors still need to address precision to get full formal
evaluation of the morphological analyzer they are working on.
The paper is organized well however I can no see a nice conclusion section at
the end of the paper. The conclusion is more like a future work section.
