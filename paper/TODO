* mention further turkic transducers in future work
* get rid of now untrue facts in future-work
* finish styling
** figure out two dots
* What do you mean by "possessive morphology" and "case morphology"? Does that mean "possessive or case markers/affixes/suffixes"? Because you say "after a noun", does that mean that these are some lexical items?

== Fran ==
* update numbers
** tagset
** stems
** coverage
** statistics section
* more about tagset
* the evaluation/statistics section needs adding to.. eg. we need to describe the evaluation
* Check JNW's rewording of "The direct result of this approach was a much smaller and simpler transducer." -> "... a more concise description"

== Fran & Jonathan ==
* write \subsection{Morphological and orthographic words}
* Write conclusion
** The conclusion is a little bit too allusive about the missing forms to be handled by the analyzer. Could a better evaluation of what remains to described be given? For instance, in terms of percentage of 'static' forms for each POS?
** The paper is organized well however I can no see a nice conclusion section at the end of the paper. The conclusion is more like a future work section.
* fix abstract
* "has been widely used for other Turkic languages". Could you name the languages in the text (Turkish, Crimean Tatar and Turkmen)?
* "as depicted in table". There is no such table in the paper.
* The transducers showed good coverage between 81 - 87 % depending on the corpora. However the authors still need to address precision to get full formal evaluation of the morphological analyzer they are working on.
